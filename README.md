# Logan Magnuson's Portfolio

This is the repository for my personal portfolio, developed in July of 2022. I did not use any frameworks for the design; everything is original. All the CSS is custom, built with SASS (SCSS, to be specific). The site is completely responsive, with a toggle navigation for phone screens and a dropdown navigation menu that spans the screen's width for larger screen sizes. For the layout of most pages, I use flexbox properties, but for some of the more complex layouts, I rely on CSS grid. The form is fully functional, using Netlify's built-in form handling and a custom Zap from Zapier that notifies me about form submissions. I tried to incorporate the color theme of my logo as the heart of the design, with everything else being built around it. The logo was created and designed by me with the help of a close friend who taught me a few photoshop tricks during development and also vectorized the final result in Adobe Illustrator.

## My Logo
When designing the logo, I wanted to incorporate my two strongest passions, music and computers, into the design in the simplest way possible. I decided to use a hard drive disk and arm to represent my passion for computers and a music symbol to represent my passion for music, incorporated into my last initial. My friend who helped me design the logo and I decided that a single quarter note for the right leg of the M would be a creative way to incorporate the music symbol into the logo. The original version, which contained additional pieces, was wider, and had a larger disk has now been simplified into its current version, which has several pieces removed, is now less wide, and has a smaller disk. 
### The Color Theme
I choose this color scheme because it displays a high level of professionalism with a calm and welcoming demeanor. I believe that I am very professional in the
workplace and that I am very approachable and easy to work with; I strive to stay calm in stressful situations where others might become overwhelmed. The grey components, which are the secondary colors, represent my maturity, seriousness, and professionalism, while the green components, which are the primary color, represent my welcoming demeanor as well as my love of nature and passion for an eco-friendly future. I tried to incorporate these traits in the elements of the logo as well, where the hard drive components represent my professionalism while my initials come across as more welcoming. Green
is also my favorite color, which isnâ€™t the main reason why I chose it, although I was happy to be able to incorporate it in a meaningful way.

### Font Choice
I chose the font Candara because I believe it supports my logos theme. The font is very welcoming and easy to read, similar to an Arial style sans serif font, but also professional looking, which matches the color theory behind my logo.

## Summary and Future Design Plans
I hope you enjoyed your time visiting my portfolio today, and if you've reached this far, thanks for reading my README! In the future, I intend on expanding upon my portfolio by adding some more CSS animations as well as incorporating some cool animation into the banner areas with HTMLCanvas that will respond to the user's mouse. I'm also considering adding a landing page with some matrix rain background using HTMLCanvas techniques (I'm a huge matrix fan!). I hope you have a great rest of your day, and feel free to contact me - let's network!
